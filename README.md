# Welcome to [Portfolio](https://www.techakhil.me/)

Iâ€™m Akhil aka '*TechAkhil*', a **developer** and **designer**. I can speak multiple 'languages':), experienced in writing efficient PYTHON scripts, DJANGO and REACT apps on all platforms and browsers. I deeply care about building interfaces that are usable and pleasant for the user and indeed, COFFEE !



## About the website
Its based on **nextjs**  and  **tailwindcss**, the animations and effects using framer motion. I've used some 3d models which i picked up from sketchfab credits goes to [engine9](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/rhetorician-a89f035291d843069d73988cc0e25399) for such fabulous model. Imported them with the help of **threejs**. My complete UI process started from figma then to tailwind code.
